# Recogito Text Annotator

Work in progress on the __Recogito Text Annotator__, a JavaScript package for adding text annotation to any web page. Official successor to [RecogitoJS](https://github.com/recogito/recogito-js).

## This repository includes the changes that haven't been merged in the official package, but are required for the `@soomo/webtexts-annotator`
